Burner has it that Sarah was the one who wanted the turret (happy spouse, happy house). The family lived in the house until 1952, after which it changed hands several times. The building was used as a multi-family dwelling and for various commercial endeavours. There were even plans to build an addition on the back to house a restaurant.
